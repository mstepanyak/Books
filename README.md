# My software engineering bookshelf

Keeping up to date and constantly improving is part of the job of a software engineer.
This is a collection of books, papers, list of papers, blog or blog posts, articles that I've read/I'm going to read.
I hope it can be a source of inspiration for everyone looking for something interesting to read!
